# CyberMaze-Real
The Continued Creation Of the CyberMaze Project

CYBERMAZE

**Introduction: -**
	“There have been a lot of cyber-attacks/scams/phishing attempts recently in the news. Can you think of a good way to utilize AI/ML technology to mitigate some of these attacks?”. I pondered over the question and concluded that most of the Cyber Attacks are a result of the user being less informed than the actual attack being threatening itself. There are Millions of documents on the internet that explain the ways to prevent cybercrime, but majority of the people do not read them. Comes in CyberMaze.
	The First of its kind in Cyber Education, CyberMaze is an interactive game that helps the user learn the ways to avoid Cyber Crime/Breaches using various levels of mazes and a plethora of assets. It’s integrated AI Bot CyberBot helps the user to delve deeper into various concepts of Cyber Security.
Premise: -
	In its core, the game is a maze which has multiple paths. In every diversion, you are faced with a question. The Correct Answer takes you to the right path, and the wrong answer to the wrong one. You have a total of 3 lives and lose one life with every wrong answer. A simple maze + question game that solves the problem of reading a long list of documents and keeping the audience interested in the idea.
	But I just didn’t want to make a game that is generic and can teach people. I also wanted it to be fun and more informative. So, I obviously had to build in a few quirks of our own.

**The Maze: -**
	In this special maze, rather than us (the user) navigating the maze, it will be the viruses/cyberattacks that have to go through the gates to your PC. Your PC will be situated in the middle of the hall, and you will have to prevent the viruses from entering those gates and entering your PC. Each Virus upon interaction with the gate will lead to a question. If answered correctly, the gate will release an attack and the virus will be destroyed. But if you answer wrong, the gate will break apart and the virus will be able to attack your PC.

**The AI Bot: -**
	CyberBot will be responsible for guiding you throughout your progress in the game. When faced with a question, you will have the option to ask for CyberBot’s assistance. The CyberBot will never give direct answers, but a hint to every smart question asked. I feel this is a great way to educate people. By asking smart question and giving brainstorming hints.

**Additions: -**
	The future possibilities of the game are endless.
_CyberMaze:_
For the maze, many different modes can be added such as endless mode, time trial mode, career mode, story mode etc. We can also add different levels of difficulty in which there will be lower number of lives and harder questions the higher difficulty you chose. Once comprehensive, we can have levels based on specific cybersecurity topics such as ransomware, Log4J vulnerability, general rules etc. These levels will be pertaining to the theme they are based on for an interactive user experience. Other than that we can also have the game custom made for organizations the we collaborate with to ensure that the questions are relevant to the issues faced by these organizations.
_CyberBot:_
CyberBot will not only be limited to the task of helping player during questions. In the home screen, player will be able to specifically chat with the CyberBot where it will provide them with documents and resources regarding cybersecurity that are requested by the users. For eg, a user can type “Get me the latest CyberSecurity News. As a response, the Bot will provide the user with the affiliate links to the websites with latest cybersecurity resources and a few updated docs. This feature will be very useful for enthusiasts who just don’t want a brief knowledge of the topic and maybe get interested through the questions and want to know more about it.
_Features:_
We can add a leaderboard system and a coin/reward system to keep the players entertained. Other than that, the companies that buy the product will be able to set limits such as the minimum number of times user is required to play the game and assign levels to be completed before the deadline, etc. We will also regularly update the question database so that that the content does not get repetitive after the first try. And with more that 100 questions for each set of change (including the ones that were previously present), the user can be assured to get new questions at least 10 times of playing through the levels (This will only apply to the general levels and not custom-made ones). The questions will always be randomized and not in order to avoid any sorts of cheating/malpractices.

**Future: -**
The future of CyberMaze is boundless and as it a videogame there is always scope for improvement as far the game is trending. We can incorporate AR aspect sometime in the future to make it more enjoyable, making more complicated levels is also an option and this can not only have cybersecurity content but any content that can be presented in an MCQ format. In future, we can also change the format from Maze to a platformer to provide users with a variety of ways to interact with the game and may add in the aspect of user-built levels. This is the perspective of a single person; I am sure that there can eb many more ideas the more people are involved with the project. Therefore, being the first of its kind and with endless opportunities, CyberMaze might also pave the path for future education in general.
